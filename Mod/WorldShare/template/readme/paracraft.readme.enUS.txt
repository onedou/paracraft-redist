        Designers of any classification need to have a certain fine arts foundation,and even have certain hand drawing ability. When we use the computer todesign graphics, we are also imperceptibly using the art knowledge andaesthetics that we store in the brain. Even the advanced artificialintelligence can not replace the designer's aesthetic andart knowledge. In the end, software is only a tool. If you want to improve your graphic sense of aesthetics and design, you need to fill in the basic courses of art. In the Internet visual design, the proportion of hand drawn in Internet design is also increasing.
